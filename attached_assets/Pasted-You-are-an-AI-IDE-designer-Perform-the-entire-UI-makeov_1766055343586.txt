You are an AI IDE designer. Perform the entire UI makeover described below — remove the random “ASS” icon and purple gradient, and replace every trace with a premium, cinematic, high-end UI system. Produce final assets and design tokens (SVG icon set, favicon, CSS variables/theme JSON, updated component specs) and apply them across the app (navbar, sidebar, toolbars, empty states, onboarding, modals, favicons, code editor gutter, status bar, notifications, and any micro UI). Do not keep any purple gradient or low-effort “assistant” badge. Make everything feel premium, confident, and delightfully over-engineered.

Replace the “ASS” icon everywhere

Remove that icon from nav, header, favicons, toolbar, help button, and onboarding screens.

Replace it with a refined, minimal logomark: an abstract, geometric monogram or glyph that reads as “mark of quality” (not literal letters). Options to generate: (A) a circular badge with a clean single-stroke diagonal/chevron; (B) a simple rounded square with a centered offset dot; (C) a monoline geometric M-like glyph. Deliver SVGs for all options in light/dark variants and a simplified 16×16 favicon SVG.

Ensure the new icon scales crisp at 16, 32, 48, 96 and 512 px. Provide an accessible alt/title for each.

Color system — remove purple gradient, introduce premium palette

Stop using purple gradients entirely. Replace with a restrained, luxurious palette:

Primary background / deep base: #0F1724 (very deep charcoal)

Surface / panels: #0F1A2A or #111827 (near-black slate)

Muted surface / cards: #0D1117

Accent / highlight (metallic): #D4AF37 (gold) and supporting warm accent #B88A5D (bronze)

Neutral text: #E6EEF5 (off-white)

Subtext / disabled: #9AA6B2

Success: #2AA96E, Error: #E14B4B, Info: #2B8CF0

Use subtle satin/highlight treatment for the primary CTA: a soft vertical sheen using the gold accent only on large CTA surfaces (not entire UI gradients).

Provide a light-mode variant that preserves the “premium” feel: off-white surface #F5F5F7, charcoal text #0F1724, gold accent same as above.

All colors must be expressed as design tokens (CSS variables) with semantic names — e.g., --bg, --surface, --text-primary, --accent-metal, --muted.

Typography & motion

Primary type: Inter (variable) for UI body; Headings: Inter SemiBold or a tasteful display (if a premium display is required, use a clean modern serif for H1 only).

Use tight, elegant letter-spacing and a clear scale: 12/14/16/18/20/28/36.

Motion: minimal and tasteful. Transitions: 160ms hover, 280ms modal open, easing cubic-bezier(.2,.9,.2,1). Microinteractions should be crisp — scale 1.03 on hover for cards, 1.02 on CTAs, not heavy.

Micro-animations: subtle parallax on hero illustrations only; animated inset shadow on hover for primary buttons; Lottie for onboarding hero only (short, looped 1–2 sec).

Components & visual language

Buttons: primary = dark surface with subtle gold satin sheen near top edge and soft inner shadow; secondary = outlined with translucent glass; tertiary = text only with subtle hover underline.

Inputs: deep inset surface, 1px inner stroke, rounded 10px corners, placeholder muted at 60% opacity.

Cards: soft rounded 12–16px corners, low elevation (subtle multi-layer shadow), hover lift (translateY: -6px), border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.03).

Sidebar & navbar: glass-ish panel (backdrop blur 6px) with reduced opacity, icons inside are line + filled accent on active state.

Notifications / toasts: minimal rectangular with small gold left accent bar for success/info variants, or full amber background for urgent actions; animations slide from bottom with 200ms fade.

Editor gutter & selection: neutral dark gutter, selection highlight = translucent gold with 16% opacity (subtle), cursor accent = gold dot.

Accessibility & contrast

All text must meet WCAG AA contrast. If gold on dark fails, add subtle glow or use a slightly lighter accent (#E2BB59) for small text.

Provide focus outlines: 3px high-contrast ring (not solely an invisible shadow).

Provide an optional “reduce motion” mode that turns off parallax and Lottie.

Tone, microcopy, and UX polish

Keep microcopy sharp and confident: one-liners that feel premium, e.g., “Ready to ship. Shred the noise.” (but keep it tasteful).

Onboarding: reduce words, highlight core value, show three high-level benefits with matching premium icons.

Empty states: elegant illustrations in muted monochrome (no purple), clear CTA to get started.

Deliverables & implementation notes (what I want you to output)

Provide a design-tokens JSON or CSS variables file with full palette, typography scale, spacing scale, shadows, radii, and motion timings.

Provide a folder of SVG icons (new logomarks + system icons) in two sizes and light/dark variants.

Provide component spec list: Button, Input, Card, Sidebar, Navbar, Modal, Toast, Editor Theme (with exact CSS var mapping).

Provide a short CSS snippet example (no JS) showing how to import theme variables and apply them to body + .btn-primary (use variables only).

Provide a favicon SVG and a recommended PNG export set (16,32,48,128,512).

Quality bar — “GOOD SHIT EVER”

No placeholder gradients. No clip-art. All icons and illustrations must read as handcrafted.

High fidelity: crisp vector icons, exact pixel snapping for small sizes, proper hinting for small text.

Consistency: single shadow system, single corner radius system, single spacing scale. Do not mix visual languages.

Make every surface feel intentional and premium. If something looks “cheap,” redesign it — more negative space, more controlled contrast, less noise.

Edgecases to fix

Replace any purple brand accents in user-generated themes or saved presets automatically with the new palette while preserving intent (e.g., a user purple-> map to a tertiary slate or muted accent).

Ensure third-party plugin icons are visually harmonized: wrap them in a neutral circular mask with subtle border when shown in UI lists so nothing clashes.

Remove or hide any procedural gradients in exported screenshots or onboarding videos; use the premium palette.

Tone and voice for microcopy across the app: calm, confident, slightly irreverent but tasteful. Think “luxury tool for people who actually build things.” Keep copy short.

Now execute this redesign across the whole project: replace assets (SVGs/favicons), export design tokens, update theme variables, and produce the component spec sheet so a developer can drop these tokens into the app and have the UI feel premium instantly.
